# Mongoid Tracer

Mongoid Tracer stores traces of your Mongoid document changes and deletions, including changes and deletions of embedded documents.

Changes of non embedded associated document can also be traced, even the changes of properties not corresponding with a Mongoid field or relation at all.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-tracer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mongoid-tracer

## Usage

Include the module `Mongoid::Tracer` in the models you want to trace

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Tracer

  field           :title
  field           :body
  field           :rating
  embeds_many     :comments
  
  #By default the fields created_at, updated_at and _type are excluded from traces.
  #You can ignore more fields by
  #trace_ignore :rating, comments
end

class Comment
  include Mongoid::Document

  field             :title
  field             :body
  embedded_in       :post, inverse_of: :comments
  
  #Even when a model doesn't include the `Mongoid::Tracer` you can configure trace options
  #since it can be traced via associations through others associated models
  #trace_ignore :title
end
```

## Development
